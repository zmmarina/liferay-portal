strategy-description=Choose the strategy for determining the provider account that each site should connect to:\  -  (A) Always Inherit: Always use the "Default Account Number" above for every site. This account number cannot be changed or overridden. This is useful is you want all provider requests to go to a single account regardless of where the request originates.\  -  (B) Provide or Inherit: An account number can be specified per site by going to [Your Site] -> Configuration -> Settings -> Custom Fields -> Click to Chat Embedded Script. However, if it's left blank, the site will use the "Default Embedded Script". This is useful to provide a global default and allow sites to customize if needed.\  -  (C) Provide: An account number can be specified per site by going to [Your Site] -> Configuration -> Settings -> Custom Fields -> Click to Chat Embedded Script. If it's left blank, this effectively disables provider for the given site. This is useful to force all sites to provide their own account number explicitly.
